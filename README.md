OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
For the library management system we use python's online compiler as platform.

1. Dataset Preparation
Data Collection: You may have user data (borrowing history, genres, return dates), book data (genre, author, popularity), or circulation data (borrow and return times).
Feature Selection: Identify relevant features for clustering, such as:
User activity (books borrowed per month, favorite genres)
Book features (popularity, genre, author)
Borrowing time, duration of use, or frequency.

2. Clustering Algorithms
a. K-means Clustering:
Description: Partitions data into K clusters by minimizing the variance within clusters.
Steps:
Initialize K cluster centroids.
Assign each data point to the nearest centroid.
Recalculate centroids and repeat until convergence.
Use case: Identifying common user profiles or book usage patterns based on features like borrowing frequency and genre.
b. Hierarchical Clustering:
Description: Builds a hierarchy of clusters by either agglomerative (bottom-up) or divisive (top-down) approaches.
Steps:
Start with individual points as their own clusters.
Merge the closest clusters until one large cluster is formed.
Generate a dendrogram to visualize the hierarchy.
Use case: Organizing books or users based on multi-level categories, like genre sub-categories or behavior groupings.
c. DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise):
Description: Forms clusters based on the density of data points, with the ability to handle noise (outliers).
Steps:
Identify core points that have a certain number of neighbors within a specified radius.
Expand clusters from these core points.
Mark points that are not part of any cluster as outliers.
Use case: Identifying natural groupings among users or books, especially when the data contains noise or outliers (like infrequent borrowers).

3. Evaluation Metrics
After performing clustering, it's important to assess the quality of the results:
Silhouette Score: Measures how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. Values range from -1 (incorrect clustering) to 1 (well-clustered).
Davies-Bouldin Index: A ratio of the intra-cluster distances to inter-cluster distances, with lower values indicating better clustering.

4. Visualization
2D Plotting: Use techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) or t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) to reduce dimensionality and visualize clusters in a 2D or 3D space.
Dendrograms (for hierarchical clustering): Visualize the hierarchy of cluster formations.
Cluster Plots: Display clusters with different colors to understand their distribution.
