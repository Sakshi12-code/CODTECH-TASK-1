# OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
**LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM:**
For the library management system we use python's online compiler as platform.

# Objective
The objective of this program is to implement a Library Management System that allows users to perform various tasks related to managing books in a library. 

# Key Activities
**1. Dataset Preparation:<br/>**
Data Collection: You may have user data (borrowing history, genres, return dates), book data (genre, author, popularity), or circulation data (borrow and return times).<br/>

Feature Selection: Identify relevant features for clustering, such as:
User activity (books borrowed per month, favorite genres)
Book features (popularity, genre, author)
Borrowing time, duration of use, or frequency.

**2. Clustering Algorithms:<br/>**
a. K-means Clustering:<br/>
Partitions data into K clusters by minimizing the variance within clusters.

b. Hierarchical Clustering:<br/>
Builds a hierarchy of clusters by either agglomerative (bottom-up) or divisive (top-down) approaches.

c. DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise):<br/>
Forms clusters based on the density of data points, with the ability to handle noise (outliers).

**3. Evaluation Metrics:<br/>**
After performing clustering, it's important to assess the quality of the results:<br/>
Silhouette Score: Measures how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. <br/>
Davies-Bouldin Index: A ratio of the intra-cluster distances to inter-cluster distances, with lower values indicating better clustering.

**4. Visualization: <br/>**
2D Plotting: Use techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) or t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) to reduce dimensionality and visualize clusters in a 2D or 3D space.<br/>
Dendrograms (for hierarchical clustering): Visualize the hierarchy of cluster formations.<br/>
Cluster Plots: Display clusters with different colors to understand their distribution.

# Technologies and Libraries used
**1. Python Programming Language:** <br/>
The program is written entirely in Python, leveraging its object-oriented features like classes, methods, and attributes.
Python provides built-in functionalities like input/output, loops, conditionals, and error handling to implement the logic.

**2. Core Python Features:** <br/>
Classes and Objects: The program uses custom classes like Book and Library to represent entities and their behaviors (e.g., managing books, issuing/returning books).<br/>
Dictionaries: Pythonâ€™s built-in dictionary data structure is used to store and manage books and issued books (self.books and self.issued_books). <br/>
String Methods: Used for case-insensitive searching and formatting output.<br/>
Input and Output: The program uses input() to interact with the user and print() to display messages and results.<br/>

**3. No External Libraries:** <br/>
This program does not use any third-party libraries or packages. It runs on any system that has a Python interpreter installed (Python 3.x).

# Key Concepts
**Error Handling via Validation:** <br/>
The program checks whether a book exists before issuing or returning it, ensuring that invalid operations are prevented (e.g., trying to issue a non-existent book).

**Basic Command-Line Interface (CLI):** <br/>
The program interacts with the user through a simple text-based menu system, guiding the user through available operations like adding, displaying, issuing, returning, and searching for books.

**Modular Design:** <br/> 
The program is divided into separate functions (e.g., add_book, issue_book, return_book), making the code modular and easier to maintain, read, and extend.
